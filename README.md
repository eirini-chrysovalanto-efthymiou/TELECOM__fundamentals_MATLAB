Fundamental MATLAB code examples

I have included core theory and exercises related to **Telecommunications**, based on the academic course *"Introduction to Digital Technologies"* from the Department of Physics.

The code is thoroughly commented to help you understand the logic and purpose behind each command.

To help you navigate this repository:
- The `content` folder contains structured summaries of theory and foundational concepts.
- Files named with `lab_` contain practical exercises or implementations specific to telecommunications.
- Other files provide either basic building blocks or self-contained examples based on their name.
