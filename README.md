Fundamental MATLAB code examples

I have included core theory and exercises related to **Telecommunications**, based on the academic course *"Introduction to Digital Technologies"* from the Department of Physics.

The code is thoroughly commented to help you understand the logic and purpose behind each command.

To help you navigate this repository:
- The `content` folder contains structured summaries of theory and foundational concepts.
- Files named with `lab_` contain practical exercises or implementations specific to telecommunications.
- Other files provide either basic building blocks or self-contained examples based on their name.


## ðŸ“¡ Telecommunications Exercises

The following telecommunications-related exercises were implemented by building on **MATLAB matrix theory**, using matrix operations to structure and analyze signals efficiently.

### âœ… Topics Covered:

1. **AWGN Noise Matrix**  
   - Generated a 10Ã—10 matrix with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)  
   - Reshaped it into a 1D vector  
   - Plotted the noise samples  
   âž¤ Demonstrates channel noise modeling using matrices

2. **900 MHz Carrier Signal**  
   - Created a sinusoidal carrier at 900 MHz (one period)  
   - Added Gaussian noise to simulate transmission over a noisy channel  
   - Plotted both the clean and noisy signals  
   âž¤ Represents carrier-based transmission with noise

3. **1 kHz Baseband Signal Sampled at 10 kHz**  
   - Created a 1 kHz baseband signal  
   - Sampled it at 10 kHz  
   - Built a time array from 0 to 100 ms  
   âž¤ Explores sampling and signal digitization

These exercises were all solved using **MATLAB matrix tools and indexing**, with clean plots and detailed comments designed for academic learning.
